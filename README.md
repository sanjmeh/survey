Survey analysis of students who took a self evaluation questionnaire on 4 major categories:
- "Communication", 
- "Confidence", 
- "Competence",
- "Collaboration"

The code picks up two sheets, one excel sheet with scores, coming from an LMS export and another google sheet that contains the evaluation key.
Output is a Google sheet that combines the recommendation for each candidate into 4 paragraphs.
This is the mail merge ready output.
